# DnD-character-generator

Hi! This is an ongoing personal project to make Dungeons & Dragons 5e character creation faster, easier, and nicer to read. 

HOW TO USE:
Please download this prject as a .zip file, decompress it, and then open the HTML file in the browser of your choice.

For now, characters are limited to the first level and spell numbers are static; even if your character is not a spellcaster, the 'Spells' slot will be visible (albeit with empty tabs). I hope to expand its functionality in the future but this is what I've got for now. This is also why I've limited races to the most basic ones. Perhaps someday I'll get around to adding the ones I missed.

Using Ctrl+S on the page WILL NOT save your information. Please use the Save button instead!

Here's how I learned to make the information downloadable: //www.encodedna.com/javascript/how-to-save-form-data-in-a-text-file-using-javascript.htm
